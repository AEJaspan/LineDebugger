# Steps

## HelloWorld example

first - run the hello world example - creates a type script extension. To run this, do:

```
code helloworld
```
then run `f5` or the command Debug: Start Debugging from the Command Palette `(Ctrl+Shift+P)` This will compile and run the extension in a new Extension Development Host window.

Run the Hello World command from the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) in the new window.

to add this to github, i have removed the .git from the helloworld. we would need to do something different when it comes to publishing

Choose the "New Extension Pack" option from the menu.

Now, i've copied some code across from the helloworld example to have a play with options


```
code helloworld
```
then run `f5` or the command Debug: Start Debugging from the Command Palette `(Ctrl+Shift+P)` This will compile and run the extension in a new Extension Development Host window.
